## Autobiography

**pique** /piːk/

**repique** /ʁə.pik/

> The words "pique" and "repique" are of Spanish origin

> Although it often scores poorly, it is usually advantageous to declare it to prevent the opponent from scoring pique or repique, despite the tactical disadvantage of giving information to the opponent


This project started from [#issues/932](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/issues/932) when I went through full issues list (Not just opened)

I caught up with a quote in that issue 'the best option is to change these, and you already found how to do it :)'

Since then I patched my own version since the author encouraged these alternative changes

I don't want to rewrite everything, it's boring

The more I patched it the more dull idea became volatile

Finally I found myself become partner of it, I learned golang in deep because of it and notepad++ is the only tooling reflecting these source code for me on Windows

I decide to share a whole of these reformed code for community

This is a show case of AMAZING project



## Overview

Less than 7mb (pure binary size of compiled copy)

Better than original one comparing to most aspect


## Comparison between repique and dnscrypt-proxy

1.  Rewritten all protocols baseline (dnscrypt,tls,dns)
2.	Improved debug info – principal stage of a program
3.	Improved flows of data handling
4.	Improved general design
5.	Strict & Small & Smart
