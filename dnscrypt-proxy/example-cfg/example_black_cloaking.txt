# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THIS FILE YOU HAVE TO RESTART THE PROGRAM IN ORDER TO SEE THEIR EFFECTS.
#
# This is the <Example File> for a conception of [black_cloaking_routine] refer to the configuration.
# Can rename this file to any name you want. IN example-dnscrypt-proxy.toml 'routine.txt'
#
# It contains user-defined mappings between domain names and addresses.
# It matches both dns request(QNAME) and response(CNAME if carry with)
#
# The standard format is: TARGET PATTERN [PATTERN2] [PATTERN3] ...
#
# Where TARGET is in dotted-quad notation for IPv4 or in colon-separated groups for IPv6 or shortenings in specialty
# IPv6 address must be enclosed in square brackets
# Where PATTERN or PATTERNs are strings separated by white spaces.
#
# A line starting with any whitespace and the '#' character
# (and everything after it if it's found within a line and in back of whitespace characters)
# is considered a comment and therefore ignored.
# e.g.
# #comments blah-blah-blah
#             #comments: whitespace blah-blah-blah
#     127.0.0.1 localhost #comments: following blah-blah-blah
# 127.0.0.1 /localhost#thisisnotacomment #comments: '/localhost#thisisnotacomment' is considered as a match
#
# PATTERN can be a fully qualified domain name (ended with a dot)
# Notice: A fully qualified domain name for PATTERN is Case Sensitive
#
# e.g. foxnews.com.
#
# PATTERN can also be regular expressions if starting with a '/' character:
# Notice: Regular Expressions for PATTERN is Case Insensitive by default
#
# 127.0.0.1 /^ads?\..*$
# 1.1.1.1 /^static0[1-9]\.quad9\.net\.$     #comments: regex='/^static0[1-9]\.quad9\.net\.$'
# 9.9.9.9 /^fake\.cloudflare\.com\.$ faker.1.1.1.1. #comments: regex='/^fake\.cloudflare\.com\.$' and domain=faker.1.1.1.1.
#
# Note that there's no final '/' at the end of a regular expression. More info about the regular expression engine and
# its syntax can be found online.
# Regular expression is a considerable and formal solution substitutes wildcard characters.
# \Q...\E is useful for literal text e.g. RF /\.google\.com\.$ is equal to RF /\Q.google.com.\E
#
# Negative responses for NXDOMAIN=NX and REFUSED=RF entries 
# can also be mapped to domain names or regular expressions using all of the possibilities
#

# RF /\.google\.com\.$
# RF /^ads?\..*$
#
# NX /\.google\.com\.$
# NX /^ads?\..*$
#
# If a regex match is determinable to both RF and NX, dedicated match is RF. 
# (for above case RF www.google.com. will take effect)
#
# The best way to effectively blocking every domain except the ones you explicitly allow is manipulating complex regular expressions.
#
#
# To minimize resources, only one file can be associated to certain listener.
# Listeners can share one file or use their independent one.
#

## Example of both invalid and valid patterns:
##
##
## *.example.com      | warning: program panics because '*' is not quantifiable
## example.com        | matches any domain name contains example(any character)com e.g. example0com.org.xyz
## example\.com\.$    | matches example.com and all names within that zone such as www.example.com
## .*\.example\.com\.$| matches all names within that zone such as www.example.com
## ^ads\..*           | matches anything with an "ads." prefix
## sex                | matches any name containing that substring
## ^ads[0-9]*         | matches "ads" followed by zero or more digits
## ^ads[0-9]+         | matches "ads" followed by one or more digits
## ^ads.*\.example.*  | hint: using '^' prefix and '\.$' suffix are faster than pattern contains any character literally
